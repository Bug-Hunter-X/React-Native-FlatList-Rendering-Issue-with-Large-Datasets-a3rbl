The solution involves using a unique key for each item in the FlatList's data array. This key should be stable and not change unless the item itself changes. This ensures that FlatList correctly identifies and renders each item.

Also ensure that state updates are performed efficiently, perhaps using `useMemo` or `React.memo` where appropriate to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components.

```javascript
//Corrected Code
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

This corrected code uses the `keyExtractor` prop to specify a unique key for each item based on its `id` property.  If your data doesn't have an `id` you should add one.  If you only have an index, you can use `index` as the key only if items are not going to be added or removed.  However, using an id is highly recommended for consistency.
