# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets. The bug manifests as missing items or blank spaces appearing in the rendered list, especially during fast scrolling or after a screen rotation.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in how `FlatList` reuses list items for optimization. If keys are not correctly managed or state updates are not handled properly, `FlatList` may reuse items incorrectly, leading to the visual glitches. This is particularly noticeable with large datasets where many items are being rendered and recycled.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring unique and stable keys for each item in the `data` prop and handling state updates efficiently to prevent `FlatList` from getting confused about item positions.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Scroll the FlatList quickly to observe the bug.

## How to Fix

Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected implementation, which includes improved key management and state update handling.
