This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render a large number of items.  The issue manifests as blank spaces or missing items in the rendered list, especially when scrolling quickly or after a screen rotation. This happens because FlatList optimizes rendering by reusing list items; however, if there's improper key management or state updates, it can lead to incorrect item rendering or positioning. 

```javascript
//Buggy Code
<FlatList
  data={this.state.data}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```
